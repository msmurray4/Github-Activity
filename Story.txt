Our story begins on a typical chilly Wisconsin night with students all packed into College library studying for midterms. No one could have predicted what would happen next.
All of a sudden a giant dinosaur came wandering down observatory drive to the students surprise. Students ran to the windows to watch with some students being left behind 
thier music playing too loud too zoned into their work to even witness the miraculous sight.
