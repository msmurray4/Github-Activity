Our story begins on a typical chilly Wisconsin night with students all packed into College library studying for midterms. No one could have predicted what would happen next.
All of a sudden a giant dinosaur came wandering down observatory drive to the students surprise. Students ran to the windows to watch with some students being left behind 
thier music playing too loud too zoned into their work to even witness the miraculous sight.

The dinosaur quickly went to the computer science section and began reading up on version control software to study for his upcoming midterm. 
Sadly, he had a hard time accessing the books because his arms were too short to get them. He has to resort to using his teeth to grab the books. 
In doing so, he accidently tore the books, and began to cry. One caring student walked over to make sure everything was ok.

In a comforting voice the student asked "would you like some help with your studies?". The dinosaur replied "its no use, I'm not meant to be a software engineer. This was just a pipe dream". The caring student sulked, "well my names dave and I dont think you should quit. As a matter of fact I have a cousin who's a data scientist at google and guess what?". "What" replied the dinosaur. "Hes a pterodactyl" replied dave.... Dave went on to invent a book selling website but was squeezed out of the business by his partner, Jeff Bezos.
